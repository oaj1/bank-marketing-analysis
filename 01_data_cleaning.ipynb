    "### Best Practice for This Dataset\n",
    "Instead of dropping or imputing these values, the recommended approach is to **treat `'unknown'` as its own category**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "1. **Information Value**  \n",
    "   - `'unknown'` may carry meaningful signal. For example, a client who refuses to disclose loan or housing status could behave differently from one who openly reports it.  \n",
    "   - In some cases, “unknown” is not missing at random—it reflects a real client decision or data collection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoiding Bias**  \n",
    "   - Imputing with the mode (or another value) risks distorting distributions and introducing bias.  \n",
    "   - Dropping rows with unknown values would result in losing a **large number of records** (especially for `default` with ~8,600 unknowns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency with Categorical Encoding**  \n",
    "   - Since these variables are categorical, adding `\"unknown\"` as a legitimate category ensures the model treats it appropriately, just like `\"yes\"` or `\"no\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Conclusion**:  \n",
    "For **job, marital, education, default, housing, and loan**, keep `\"unknown\"` as its own category. This preserves all records and avoids losing potential predictive signal, while staying faithful to the dataset’s real-world context.\n"

    "2. **Skew and Outliers**  \n",
